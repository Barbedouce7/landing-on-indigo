# 1. Structure of the Indigo Ecosystem :

The Indigo Protocol enables the creation and management of synthetic assets, providing access to decentralized financial tools with the security and scalability of the Cardano blockchain.

## Indigo Foundation & DAO

The **Indigo Foundation** connects the **DAO** to the real world.
It manages resources, fosters relationships, and provides structure to the ecosystem.
Its goal is long-term stability and growth through community-driven initiatives.

The **foundation** supports the **Indigo DAO**, the decision-making body composed of **INDY token holders**, who actively vote on proposals to shape the ecosystem (e.g., introducing a new iAsset or updating parameters).


## Indigo Labs

Indigo Labs drives development efforts, working on new features and enhancements, such as Protocol V2. The team is elected by the DAO.


## Working groups
Indigo also relies on working groups, elected by the DAO, that focus on key objectives supporting various elements of the ecosystem.


- PWG (Protocol Working Group): Focuses on strategic protocol development and adjustments.

- TWG (Technical Working Group): Serves as a technical advisory group.

- POG (Protocol Outreach Group): Prioritizes community engagement, education, and outreach.

Together, the Indigo ecosystem — starting with the DAO, and including the foundation and working groups — is building a decentralized future where finance is open, accessible, and driven by community collaboration.
